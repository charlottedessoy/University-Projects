Coursework in R for my time series analysis module in my final year of studies. Content:
Probability models for time series: Stationarity; moving average (MA), autoregressive (AR), ARMA and ARIMA models. 
Estimating the autocorrelation function and fitting ARIMA models. 
Forecasting: Exponential smoothing, Forecasting from ARIMA models. 
Stationary processes in the frequency domain: The spectral density function, the periodogram, spectral analysis. 
State-space models: Dynamic linear models and the Kalman filter.
