The Second coursework instalment for my Introduction to Data Science module I completed in my final year of university. This comprised of working with text data on the novel Frankenstein looking at term frequency and sentiment analysis. The second question addresses squirrel sightings across the UK and some data analysis on their distributions. Then a question on sentiment analysis on customer reviews, and finally a more exploratory analysis involving spatial data. This project used R and R studio, with the output being a markdown pdf.
